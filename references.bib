   abstract = {Computational geometry and topology are areas which have much potential for the analysis of arbitrarily high-dimensional data sets. In order to apply geometric or topological methods one must first generate a representative point cloud data set from the original data source, or at least a metric or distance function, which defines a distance between the elements of a given data set. Consequently, the first question is: How to get point cloud data sets? Or more precise: What is the optimal way of generating such data sets? The solution to these questions is not trivial. If a natural image is taken as an example, we are concerned more with the content, with the shape of the relevant data represented by this image than its mere matrix of pixels. Once a point cloud has been generated from a data source, it can be used as input for the application of graph theory and computational topology. In this paper we first describe the case for natural point clouds, i.e. where the data already are represented by points; we then provide some fundamentals of medical images, particularly dermoscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and total-body photography; we describe the use of graph theoretic concepts for image analysis, give some medical background on skin cancer and concentrate on the challenges when dealing with lesion images. We discuss some relevant algorithms, including the watershed algorithm, region splitting (graph cuts), region merging (minimum spanning tree) and finally describe some open problems and future challenges [Graph-based Data Mining].},

In particular, the analysis is important for improving the estimation of the parameter set for the used heuristic in the field of route planning. Moreover, we describe some methods from quantitative graph theory and outline a few potential research routes.},

   abstract = {Graph-based knowledge representation is a hot topic for some years and still has a lot of research potential, particularly in the advancement in the application of graph-theory for creating benefits in the biomedical domain. Graphs are most powerful tools to map structures within a given data set and to recognize relationships between specific data objects. Many advantages of graph-based data structures can be found in the applicability of methods from network analysis, topology and data mining (e.g. small-world phenomenon, cluster analysis). In this paper we present the state-of-the-art in graph-based approaches for multi-touch interaction on mobile devices and we highlight some open problems to stimulate further research and future developments. This is particularly important in the medical domain, as a conceptual graph analysis may provide novel insights on hidden patterns in data, hence support interactive knowledge discovery.[Graph-based Data Mining]},
